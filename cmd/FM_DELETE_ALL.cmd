COMMAND CFS FM_DELETE_ALL BIG_ENDIAN "This command deletes all files in the source directory. Source must be an existing directory. Open files and sub-directories are not deleted. Because of the possibility that this command might take a very long time to complete, command argument validation will be done immediately but reading the directory and deleting each file will be performed by a lower priority child task. As such, the return value for this function only refers to the result of command argument verification and being able to place the command on the child task interface queue."
