COMMAND CFS CFE_TIME_SET_SOURCE BIG_ENDIAN "This command selects the Time Service clock source. Although the list of potential clock sources is mission specific and defined via configuration parameters, this command provides a common method for switching between the local processor clock and an external source for time data.   When commanded to accept external time data (GPS, MET, spacecraft time, etc.), the Time Server will enable input via an API function specific to the configuration definitions for the particular source. When commanded to use internal time data, the Time Server will ignore the external data. However, the Time Server will continue to use the API function as the trigger to generate a 'time at the tone' command packet regardless of the internal/external command selection.   Notes: Operating in FLYWHEEL mode is not considered a choice related to clock source, but rather an element of the clock state. See below for a description of the CFE_TIME_SET_STATE_CC command.This command is only valid when the CFE_TIME_CFG_SOURCE configuration parameter in the cfe_platform_cfg.h file has been set to TRUE. "
